            <p>
                Ramil is an independent artist based out of Mumbai. Growing up in a house full of artists and having a knack for playing guitar from a very early age, he discovered music as a way of communicating his feelings. His compositions reflect his love for guitar music, metaphoric lines, and pleasant tunes. 
                <br><br>
                Singles from his new EP- Gulmohar, have been appreciated by Rolling Stones magazine and have garnered a lot of attention over online media. Ramil is now looking forward to exploring new sounds and creating new stuff in the coming year. 
                <br><br>
                If there's anything that can be seen as maintained throughout Ramil's discography is a unique brand value that combines smooth vocals and sweet harmonies into contemporary rhythms.
